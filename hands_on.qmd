### Setup

- Terminal + Text Editor (VS Code)

- Visual Studio Code has options to use quarto in a better user interface

---

- Run the command 'quarto create project website <mysite>'

- Alternatively, ctrl+shift+p and create the quarto project

- Automatically Quarto will create the following directory structure:
    - _quarto.yml
    - index.qmd
    - about.qmd
    - styles.css

### Structure

- .yml files
    - YAML is a human-readable data serialization language
    - YAML is an official strict superset of JSON despite looking very different from JSON.
    - To create a YAML file, use either the .yaml or .yml file extension.

- .qmd files
    - Work as markdown files, but they have a configuration section in yml on the top of the file

---

- _quarto.yml
    - Defines the basic structure of the website.
    - All configurations are done using yml
    - Some of the configurations:
        - Navigation bar
        - Side bar
        - Contents 

## Listings {.smaller}

- Listings enable you to automatically generate the contents of a page (or region of a page) from a list of Quarto documents or other custom data

- Useful to create blogs, newletters

## Programing

- Quarto also provides the option to embed some code on your website

- Quarto supports Python, R, Julia and Observable Javascript

- You can create a code block delimiting using ```

- Example of code running: [https://tailor-uob.github.io/training-material/cha_odm/odm.html](https://tailor-uob.github.io/training-material/cha_odm/odm.html)

## Programing

- Also Quarto allows the creation of short codes.

- Shortcodes are special markdown directives that generate various types of content. Quarto shortcodes are similar in form and function to Hugo shortcodes and WordPress shortcodes.
